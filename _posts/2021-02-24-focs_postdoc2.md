## Important  dates

- Application deadline: **12.04.2021**;
- Review and interview process until: **5.05.2021**;
- Start of the position: **June 2021**; (*subject to negotiations; we take into account the current pandemic situation and academic life-cycle*)


## Project

We offer a 2-year research position for a post-doctoral researcher in the project aimed at developing, evaluating and applying innovative methodology of comparing large texts collections. The project is located in one of the world's most recognizable stylometry centers, Kraków, led by professor Maciej Eder. 

Our lab, [Computational Stylistics Group](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/) at the Institute of Polish Language of Polish Academy of Sciences is based in Kraków, Poland, and gathers researchers from various disciplines, from literary studies to linguistics, to computer science and physics. Our lab is a member of the Federation of Stylometry Labs (FoSL), it coordinates the Horizon 2020 "Computational Literary Studies Infrastructure" project, closely collaborates with the COST Action "Distant Reading", as well as the Digital Literary Stylistics Special Interest Group (SIG) affiliated with the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations. Located in the heart of Europe, we benefit from a dense network of connections to European research centers and capitals.

## Offer

The position is available for 2 years and funded by the Polish National Science Centre. We offer access to good infrastructure, a comfortable salary with various benefits (including paid holiday, health care and social security). We offer a monthly salary of 4,600 PLN, the median in Poland being 4,094 PLN in 2020.

Apart from the remuneration, the job holder will have access to funding for conferences and research visits, and can benefit from the group's involvement in various international collaboration programs (e.g. COST Action Distant Reading, funded research visit program with group's branch at the University of Antwerp) as well as the guidance of the project leader in career building and applying for further funding.

The position can start as early as June 2021 (subject to negotiations; we take into account the current pandemic situation and academic life-cycle). While we love to work in our office, we are aware that moving to Kraków these days might be difficult; therefore, working remotely from wherever you are is also an option, at least for some time.



## Candidate profile

We are looking for a candidate who is interested in building text analysis and stylometry solutions for the future. While our requirements are quite flexible, we expect the candidate to have some background in computational text analysis and at least basic programming skills in one of the following languages: R, Python, Matlab, Julia, Mathematica, Octave (while this is not a must-have at the beginning, we expect you to know the principles of working with text, and to be able to write, test and improve short programs when needed, use version control systems, e.g. Git, and understand and apply machine learning algorithms to the studies). Deeper knowledge of statistical modeling and machine learning is also welcome.

A very good command of spoken and written English is sufficient for communication within and outside the laboratory as Kraków is quite international. We hope to find a candidate able both to conduct research independently and ready to engage in team work.

As a formal requirement, at the date of starting job the successful candidate must have obtained a PhD, however not earlier than within the last 7 years.



## Main duties and responsibilities

The exact tasks will be determined upon considering interests of the successful candidate but are expected to relate to:

* participating in developing theoretical foundations of computational stylistics; specifically, contributing to one of the subprojects as described at the [project’s website](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/projects/focs/): in the first year you will be expected to select a subproject and create a plan of it, and in the second year to obtain and publish first results,
* contributing to empirical evaluation of existing and newly created stylometric methods on corpora in various languages,
* publishing on the related issues both on their own and with the group,
* participating in doctoral seminars – advising and co-supervising doctoral student(s),
* engaging in the popularization of methods by participating in workshops and international initiatives.



## How to apply

Candidates are encouraged to contact prof. Maciej Eder via the team's official email (csg@stylometry.org) with:
* a CV (including publication list), 
* a cover letter with a short description of your past research and your interest in the project,
* contact details of two referees (e-mail address and phone numbers, please don’t send recommendation letters at this point),
* a scan of a signed copy of [the information on the processing of personal data in the recruitment process](https://ijp.pan.pl/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IJPPAN_Recruitment_RODO_EN.pdf).

The deadline for applications is 12th April 2021, selected candidates will then be contacted for a remote interview in late April or early May. We expect to finish processing the application by the end of May.
 
In case of any questions please contact us via CSG email (csg@stylometry.org).
