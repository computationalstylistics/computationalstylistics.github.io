Our paper on handwritten text recognition is out! Check out [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-77961-0_13). A pre-print version can be found [here](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/preprints/blob/master/ICCS_paper_482.pdf). Also, a talk about the project (in Polish) is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hflvlWzbDts).
