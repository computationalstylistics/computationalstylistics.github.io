  <article class="post-content Language Change clearfix">
    <p>This 3-year project, founded by the <a href="https://ncn.gov.pl/?language=en">National Science Centre</a> (OPUS 2013/11/B/HS2/02795), entitled “Przebiegi zmian gramatycznych i leksykalnych w historii języka polskiego – metody korpusowe i kwantytatywne w językoznawstwie diachronicznym” (“Course of grammatical and lexical changes in the history of the Polish language – corpus-driven quantitative methods in diachronic linguistics”), is aimed at an investigation of grammatical and lexical changes, focusing on trends and dynamics of changes in the middle and modern Polish period. What makes this approach innovative is an extensive use of methods elaborated by quantitative and corpus linguistics. A purpose-built diachronic corpus of Polish (ca. 25 mln word tokens) has been statistically analysed in order to observe various changes in the course of development of the Polish language.</p>

<p>The second objective (considered even more important by the authors) is to elaborate statistical tools, which allow for description of the course of linguistic changes, their dynamics, and particularly their parallel coocurrences. We aim at developing a methodology which will combine a diachronic large-scale analysis with an automatic identification of the specific grammatical and lexical features responsible for a language change.</p>

</ul>

<p>Below, we briefly present – as appetizers of full-length papers to appear – two studies conducted within the project. The first study aims at modeling isolated language changes using logistic regression, whereas the second introduces a new method of assessing the dynamics of language change <em>en mass</em>.</p>

<h2 id="piotrowskis-law">Piotrowski’s law</h2>

<p>One can hardly imagine a different picture of a language change than that it starts among a small (possibly sociologically or spatially restricted) group of speakers, gaining gradually more and more users over time, even if an opposition of conservative speakers retard the change. After the first period of slow dissemination, however, the change accelerates, until the newly introduced form is broadly accepted by language users. The recessive form gradually becomes rare, and finally dies out, partly because its adherents die as well. Certainly, it takes time for the change to be completed.</p>

<p>On theoretical grounds, a change in language can follow two main scenarios. Firstly, it can be an innovation that affects a language system without displacing any already-existing forms. In general, newly introduced vocabulary falls into this category (e.g. the emergence of the word <em>nettiquette</em> in the system does not force the word <em>etiquette</em> to disappear). The second scenario occurs when a new form simply replaces the old one, e.g. the degree to which the form <em>burned</em> (the past form of the verb <em>to burn</em>) spreads in English, by definition equals to the withdrawal of the irregular form <em>burnt</em>. In mathematical terms, the probability of finding a new form and and old form (denoted as <em>n</em> and <em>o</em>, respectively) in such a scenario is P(<em>n</em>) = 1 – P(<em>o</em>), which also implies that P(<em>o</em>) = 1 – P(<em>n</em>). Consequently, the joint frequency of the two forms might remain constant over the centuries, while their mutual proportions usually vary to a significant degree.</p>

<p>This study explores language change that can be modelled using logistic regression, which in the context of historical linguistics is often referred to as Piotrowski’s law. The examples are drawn from the Polish language. Namely, a few changes that are reported in handbooks of the history of Polish to have taken place between mid-15<sup>th</sup> and mid-19<sup>th</sup> centuries, have been used to validate the theoretical models.</p>

<p>Interesting as it is, such a model cannot overcome the problem of possible co-occurrences of several language changes. In our approach, we propose to combine multiple logistic regression models into one broader picture. An exemplary plot of such a combination is shown in Fig. 2.</p>

<h2 id="the-dynamics-of-language-change">The dynamics of language change</h2>

<p>This study aims at capturing the dynamics of language changes without manual pre-selection of the features that might be responsible for the changes. Our approach was to analyze a considerably large set of 1,000 most frequent words without any further filters. Arguably, in such a big set one should find a few dozen of function words, and a vast majority of content words.</p>

<p>The most natural choice to assess the discriminative power of numerous features at a time is to apply one of the multivariate methods. To this end, an iterative procedure of automatic text classification was applied. Its underlying idea is fairly simple: first, we formulate a working hypothesis that a certain year – be it 1835 – marks a major linguistic break. The procedure randomly picks <em>n</em> text samples written before and after the assumed break; the samples then go into the <em>ante</em> and <em>post</em> subsets. In this study, a period of 20 years before and after the assumed break was covered (with an additional gap of 10 years), 500 text samples of 1,000 tokens were harvested into each of the subsets. To give an example: for the year 1835, 500 random samples covering the time span 1810–1830 were picked into the first subset, and another 500 samples from the years 1840–1860 into the second subset. Next, the both subsets are randomly divided into two halves, so that the training set and the test contain 500 samples representing two classes (<em>ante</em> and <em>post</em>). Then we train a supervised classifier – in this case, Nearest Shrunken Centroids – and record the cross-validated accuracy rates. Then we <em>dismiss</em> the original hypothesis, in order to test new ones: we iterate over the timeline, testing the years 1836, 1837, 1838, 1839, … for their discriminating power. The assumption is simple here: any acceleration of linguistic change will be reflected by higher accuracy scores.</p>

<p>Despite the above general picture, quite interesting are individual trajectories of the high-impact words. In Fig. 4, one can observe a collinearity of function words: <em>the</em>, <em>and</em>, <em>that</em>, <em>is</em>, <em>been</em>, as opposed to the possessive <em>’s</em>. These function words seem to have impacted the language change at the turn of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
