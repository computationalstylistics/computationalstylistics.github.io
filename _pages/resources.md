## Corpora

The following selection of links is but a tip of the iceberg when it comes to the corpora (text collections) suitable for text analysis. The corpora listed below, however, are compiled by the members of CSG, and checked for compatibility with commonly known stylometric software. 

* [A Small Collection of British Fiction](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/A_Small_Collection_of_British_Fiction)
* [100 Polish Novels](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/100_polish_novels)
* [100 English Novels](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/100_english_novels)
* [68 German Novels](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/68_german_novels)
* [100 Russian Novels](https://github.com/JoannaBy/RussianNovels)
* [Latin New Testament](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/NT_Vulgate)
* [_Roman de la Rose_](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/RdlR_for_rolling_classify), to play with the [Rolling Classify](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/projects/rolling-stylometry/) method
* [ELTeC corpora](https://github.com/COST-ELTeC) - while our team prepared only the Polish corpus in the collection, we participated in all stages of collection design and strongly encourage you to check it out!  

If you're looking to test the methods on poetry or drama, we are also happy to recommend befriended projects:
* [PoeTree](https://versologie.cz/poetree/) -  "a standardized collection of poetry corpora comprising over 330,000 poems in ten languages (Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish). Each corpus has been deduplicated, enriched with Universal Dependencies, provided with additional metadata and converted into a unified JSON structure." PoeTree is a project headed by our colleagues from the Czech Academy of Sciences and is continuously growing.
* [DraCor](https://dracor.org/) - "(short for »drama corpora«) is an open digital infrastructure developed for the computational study of (mostly) European drama from Greco-Roman antiquity to the 20th century." The project includes 21 and counting corpora of dramatic works with rich encoding facilitating analysis of various levels of drama. Like in the case of PoeTree, the corpora are continuously growing.



## Documentation of the package ‘stylo’

* for (real) beginners: a crash introduction in the form of a [slideshow](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/stylo_nutshell/)
* for (sort of) beginners: a concise [HOWTO](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/stylo_howto/blob/master/stylo_howto.pdf)
* for advanced users: a paper in [R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2016/RJ-2016-007/RJ-2016-007.pdf)

## Publications

A list of relevant publications by the CSG members can be found on this website, on the subpage ‘publications‘. However, a comprehensive [Stylometry Bibliography](https://www.zotero.org/groups/643516/stylometry_bibliography), curated by Christof Schöch, is definitely a place to consult before starting any experiment in text analysis.
