## Corpora

The following selection of links is but a tip of an iceberg when it comes to the corpora (text collections) suitable for text analysis. The corpora listed below, however, are compiled by the members of CSG, and checked for compatibility with commonly known stylometric software. 

* [A Small Collection of British Fiction](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/A_Small_Collection_of_British_Fiction)
* [100 Polish Novels](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/100_polish_novels)
* [100 English Novels](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/100_english_novels)
* [68 German Novels](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/68_german_novels)
* [100 Russian Novels](https://github.com/JoannaBy/RussianNovels)
* [Latin New Testament](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/NT_Vulgate)
* [_Roman de la Rose_](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/RdlR_for_rolling_classify), to play with the [Rolling Classify](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/projects/rolling-stylometry/) method



## Documentation of the package ‘stylo’

* for (real) beginners: a crush introduction in the form of a [slideshow](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/stylo_nutshell/)
* for (sort of) beginners: a concise [HOWTO](https://sites.google.com/site/computationalstylistics/stylo/stylo_howto.pdf)
* for advanced users: a paper in [R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2016/RJ-2016-007/RJ-2016-007.pdf)
* full documentation at [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stylo/stylo.pdf)

Blog posts on non-obvious functions of `stylo`:

* [Authorship verification with the package 'stylo'](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/blog/imposters/)
* [Cross-validation using the function `classify()`](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/blog/cross-validation/)

* [Testing rolling stylometry](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/blog/rolling_stylometry/)



## Publications

A list of relevant publications by the CSG members can be found on this website, on the subpage ‘publications‘. However, a comprehensive [Stylometry Bibliography](https://www.zotero.org/groups/643516/stylometry_bibliography), curated by Christof Schöch, is definitely a place to consult before starting any experiment in text analysis.
