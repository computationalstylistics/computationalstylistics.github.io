Joanna Byszuk holds a PhD in linguistics from the [Institute of Polish Language of the Polish Academy of Sciences](https://ijp.pan.pl/en/), where she currently works as part of [the CLS Infra Horizon 2020](https://clsinfra.io/). In the past, she participated in [the Foundations of Computational Stylistics](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/projects/focs/) project and [Deep Learning in the Computational Stylistics](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/projects/deep_learning/) collaboration with University of Antwerp. 

Her research focuses on cross-lingual computational methods of text (and other media) analysis and advancing stylometric methodology and its understanding, especially locating method limitations and developing evaluation procedures. She is also interested in the concept of authorship and in discourse analysis, especially in multimodal and collaborative contexts. Her PhD project explored the application of stylometric methodology to audiovisual works, in particular television series, and extension of methods to image and sound data.

Since she arrived in CSG in 2017, she has given lectures and conducted workshops in many places around the world, including offering a course on stylometry and computational text analysis at the [Digital Humanities Summer Institute](https://dhsi.org/) six times (2018, 2019, 2024 and 2025 in person, and 2021 and 2022 in an online form). She has also co-organized Digital Humanities Lunches in Krak√≥w - the so far only semi-regular series of lectures on DH issues addressed primarily to Polish audience.
