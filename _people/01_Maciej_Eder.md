Professor of linguistics at the <a href="https://ijp.pan.pl/en/" target="_blank">Institute of Polish Language (Polish Academy of Sciences)</a> in Krakow, Poland, and Visiting Professor of Digital Humanities at the <a href="https://sisu.ut.ee/digits/team/" target="_blank">University of Tartu</a>, Estonia (<a href="http://maciejeder.org/" target="_blank">personal webpage</a>). Currently, he is also the Chair of the Committee of Linguistics at the Polish Academy of Sciences, the principal investigator of the project Computational Literary Studies Infrastructure, co-founder of the Computational Stylistics Group, and the main developer of the R package ‘Stylo’ for performing stylometric analyses. His main research area lays somewhere between literary studies and linguistics, and revolves around quantitative approaches to style variation. These include measuring style using statistical methods, authorship attribution based on quantitative measures, as well as ‘distant reading’ methods to analyze dozens (or hundreds) of literary works at a time.
