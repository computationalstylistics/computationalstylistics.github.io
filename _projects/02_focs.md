This is a 5-year research project founded by the [National Science Centre](https://ncn.gov.pl/?language=en) (SONATA-BIS 2017/26/E/HS2/01019), carried out at the Institute of Polish Language (Polish Academy of Sciences). It is aimed to develop, evaluate and apply an innovative methodology of comparing large texts collections, in order to identify hidden patterns and similarities invisible to the naked eye. The official title of the project reads: “Wielkoskalowa analiza tekstu i metodologiczne podstawy stylistyki komputerowej”, which can be translated into English as: “Large-Scale Text Analysis and Methodological Foundations of Computational Stylistics”. Since the title is somewhat long, we dropped its first part; hence the handy version “Foundations of Computational Stylistics” (FoCS).

The project will involve a team of 5-6 people, but right now there’s only two of us:

* Maciej Eder (PI)
* Joanna Byszuk (PhD candidate)

However, [we’re hiring](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/blog/focs_postdoc1/)!

The assumed impact of the project is:

* a novel outlook on language and literary creation;
* a contribution to classification techniques in the domain of textual data and in large-scale tasks, including a reexamination of traditional periodizations and classifications of literature;
* contribution to visualization techniques;
* potential contribution to any task related to text analysis: spam filtering, sentiment analysis, plagiarism detection, authorship profiling, and information retrieval.

The project is divided into five related subprojects. Subproject A is planned to explore theoretical problems of stylometric tests, including reliability issues and visualization techniques; subproject B is aimed at testing the established methodology on large corpora of literary texts in different languages, genres, themes and authorial genders in the original and in translation; subproject C will examine grammatical features as indicators of stylistic variation; subproject D will discuss style differentiation across different modes, genres, and themes in the field of one particular literary tradition – namely Latin; and, finally, subproject E will explore usefulness of sequential analysis methods to examining local stylistic changes in texts.
