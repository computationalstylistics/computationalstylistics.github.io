Continuing the medieval tradition of eating while listening to a learned person reading and interpreting learned texts, we invite everyone interested in a variety of Digital Humanities topics to join us for lunch on Fridays at 1pm CET, at the Institute of Polish Language (Polish Academy of Sciences) in Krak√≥w, Poland, or online for the following talks: [https://dhlunch.ijp.pan.pl/en/](https://dhlunch.ijp.pan.pl/en/).
